A boilerplate for **Node.js** web applications.

If you have attended any hackathons in the past, then you know how much time it takes to
get a project started: decide on what to build, pick a programming language, pick a web framework,
pick a CSS framework. A while later, you might have an initial project up on GitHub and only then
can other team members start contributing. Or how about doing something as simple as *Sign in with Facebook*
authentication? You can spend hours on it if you are not familiar with how OAuth 2.0 works.

When I started this project, my primary focus was on **simplicity** and **ease of use**.
I also tried to make it as **generic** and **reusable** as possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps,
without being too specific. In the worst case you can use this as a learning guide for your projects,
if for example you are only interested in **Sign in with Google** authentication and nothing else.
